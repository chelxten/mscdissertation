    **Title:** _The Search of Advanced AI-Powered Service Robots for Amusement Parks_

    **Legal Basis:** This study is under SHU‚Äôs ethical research framework. [Research Ethics](https://www.shu.ac.uk/research/excellence/ethics-and-integrity)

    **Invitation & Purpose:** You are invited to explore how AI can enhance service robots in amusement parks.

    **Voluntary Participation:** You may withdraw at any time. All questions must be completed to proceed.

    **Time Commitment:** ~5 minutes.

    **Risks & Benefits:** Low risk. No direct benefit, but responses will improve robotics research. Anonymous data only.

    **Data Use:** Stored securely for up to 5 years, used for MSc dissertation. No personal IDs collected.
