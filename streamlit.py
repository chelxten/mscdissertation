    ### PARTICIPANT INFORMATION SHEET

    **Title of Project**  
    _The Search of Advanced AI-Powered Service Robots for Amusement Parks_

    **Legal Basis for the Research**  
    The University undertakes research as part of its function for the community under its legal status.  
    Data protection allows us to use personal data for research with appropriate safeguards in place under the legal basis of public tasks that are in the public interest.

    All University research is reviewed to ensure participants are treated appropriately. This study has been submitted for ethical review and is awaiting approval.  
    Learn more: [Research Ethics](https://www.shu.ac.uk/research/excellence/ethics-and-integrity)

    **Invitation and Purpose of the Research**  
    You are invited to take part in a study on how AI technologies can enhance service robots in amusement parks.  
    The goal is to explore how systems like AI navigation and fuzzy logic can improve visitor interaction and adaptability.

    **Why You Have Been Invited**  
    You were selected because people in your age group frequently visit amusement parks and can provide helpful insights into service robot design.

    **Voluntary Participation**  
    Your participation is voluntary. You can withdraw at any time without reason. However, all survey questions must be answered to proceed.

    **What You Will Be Asked to Do**  
    You'll complete a short online questionnaire using sliders and multiple-choice options. There are no open-ended questions. It takes about 5 minutes.

    **Where the Study Will Take Place**  
    The entire questionnaire is online and can be accessed anytime on a phone or computer.

    **Time Commitment**  
    Completion time is approx. 5 minutes. Some participants may be invited for follow-up after robot deployment‚Äîthis is optional.

    **Use of Deception**  
    There is no deception. All study details are transparent from the beginning.

    ### Risks and Benefits

    **Risks**  
    This is a low-risk study with only standard preference and experience questions‚Äîno personal or sensitive topics.

    **Benefits**  
    Although there is no direct benefit to you, your responses will contribute to research that could improve robotics in entertainment settings.  
    All results will be anonymous and used only for education and research.

    **Data Management**  
    The researcher is responsible for secure data storage. Only the researcher and supervisor can access it.

    **Data Retention**  
    Data will be kept securely for up to five years and only used for this study.

    **Use of Results**  
    Results will be reported anonymously in the researcher‚Äôs postgraduate dissertation.

    **Study Timeline**  
    Research will run from June 2025 to September 2025.

    **Requesting Results**  
    If you‚Äôd like a summary after the study, email the researcher (see below).
