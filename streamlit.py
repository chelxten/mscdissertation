### Study Title: Exploring AI-Powered Service Robots in Amusement Parks

#### Researcher Information:
- **Name:** Cherry San  
- **Course:** MSc Artificial Intelligence, Sheffield Hallam University  
- **Email:** c3065323@hallam.shu.ac.uk  
- **Supervisor:** Dr Samuele Vinanzi (s.vinanzi@shu.ac.uk)

---

### Purpose of the Study
This project explores how AI-powered service robots can improve navigation and visitor experience in amusement parks. The system uses fuzzy logic and visitor preferences to create a personalised tour plan.

---

### What will happen if I take part?
- You will complete a short questionnaire about your visit preferences.
- Based on your answers, the system will generate a suggested personalised route.
- No personal identifiers (like names or contact details) are required unless you choose to share them voluntarily for follow-up.

---

### Voluntary Participation
Participation is entirely voluntary. You can withdraw at any time before submitting your answers by simply closing the page.

---

### Risks and Benefits
- **Risks:** Minimal. The questionnaire asks only general, non-sensitive preferences.
- **Benefits:** Your insights help us improve the design of visitor-focused service robots.

---

### Confidentiality
- Your responses are anonymous and will be stored securely.
- Data will be used only for academic research purposes and shared in a way that does not identify you.

---

### Contact
If you have questions, you may contact the researcher or supervisor using the email addresses above.
