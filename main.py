    ### Title of Project  
    *The Search of Advanced AI-Powered Service Robots for Amusement Parks*

    ### Legal Basis for the Research  
    The University undertakes research as part of its function for the community under its legal status.  
    Data protection allows us to use personal data for research with appropriate safeguards in place under the legal basis of public tasks that are in the public interest.

    ### Invitation and Purpose  
    You are invited to take part in a research study about the use of advanced artificial intelligence technologies to improve service robots in amusement parks. This study aims to understand how technologies like AI-driven navigation, fuzzy logic, and learning systems can help robots become more adaptable and engaging for visitors.

    ### Why You Were Invited  
    You have been invited to take part because people in your age group are typical users of amusement parks and can provide valuable insights into how technology, like service robots, could improve the visitor experience.

    ### Voluntary Participation  
    Taking part in this study is entirely voluntary. You are free to withdraw at any time, without giving a reason, and without any negative consequences. However, once you begin the questionnaire, all questions must be answered in order to complete the survey.

    ### Risks  
    This is a low-risk study. No sensitive or personal topics are involved.

    ### Benefits  
    While there is no direct benefit to you, your feedback contributes to research that supports the development of improved robotic systems in amusement parks. Results are anonymous and for educational use only.

    ### Opportunity for Questions  
    You may contact the researcher if you have any questions before or during the study.

    ### Confidentiality  
    The questionnaire collects only age and accessibility information for demographic analysis. No names are required. Contact information is optional. All data will be stored anonymously and securely.

    ### Responsibility for Data  
    The researcher is solely responsible for secure data handling in line with the university‚Äôs data policies.

    ### Access to Data

    ### Data Retention and Future Use  
    Data will be securely stored and retained for up to five years. It will only be used for this study.

    ### Use of Results  
    The study's results will appear in a postgraduate dissertation. All reporting will be anonymous.

    ### Study Duration  
    June 2025 ‚Äì September 2025 (includes data collection and analysis).

    ### Access to Results  
    To request a summary of the findings, contact the researcher via email.
